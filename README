This is Nicole De Luca's personal recreation of Minesweeper as a Command Line Interface (CLI) program in the Java programming language.

It was created in the fall of 2017, partly out of experimentation and partly out of boredom. 

The comments in the code and the instructions in the program should be sufficient to understand how it works.

Bugs:
* It is possible to lose on the first choice because the bombs are generated prior to the first input from the user. This is not the case in standard
	Minesweeper; you cannot lose on the first click. A simple fix to this would be to generate the bombs after the first user input.

* Using the 16x16 size produces a small graphical error because of the way the GUI is printed out; the numbers of the rows/columns larger than 10
	use an extra character, so everything is offset a bit.

Planned features:
* Choose your own size of board. Framework is in place, but not implemented yet.
